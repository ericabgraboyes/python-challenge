The python-challenge repository contains two separate python challengs -- PyPoll and PyBank.  

(1) PyPoll in this Challenge, the ask is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
* The vote counting process consists of a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is comprised of three columns
  ** "Voter ID"
  ** "County" 
  ** "Candidate"
 
 The task is to create a Python script to analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values:
  ** The total number of votes cast
  ** A complete list of candidates who received votes
  ** The percentage of votes each candidate won
  ** The total number of votes each candidate won
  ** The winner of the election based on popular vote

The final analysis should print the results to the terminal as well as write the results to text file.
NOTE: the resources folder and anaylsis folder are saved in the same "parent" folder as the python script (PyPoll), such that they can be read in and written using a relative reference


(2) In this Challenge, the ask is to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. 
* The financial data consists of a single CSV file called budget_data.csv. The dataset consists of two columns:
    ** "Date"
    ** "Profit/Losses"

The task is to create a Python script to analyze the records and to calculate each of the following values:
    ** The total number of months included in the dataset
    ** The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    ** The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
    ** The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    ** The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    
The final analysis should print the results to the terminal as well as write the results to text file.
NOTE: the resources folder and anaylsis folder are saved in the same "parent" folder as the python script (PyBank), such that they can be read in and written using a relative reference
